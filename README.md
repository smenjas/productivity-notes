# Productivity Notes

You're most effective in certain mental states and at certain times of day.
Avoid distractions during those times.

Set small, achievable, short term goals.  As in minutes.  Iterate rapidly.
Formalize your process (write it down, critique it, edit it, refine it).
Eliminate friction in your feedback loops.

You can only concentrate for so long before you become tired, and your body
needs exercise.  Have work sessions no more than 45 minutes ideally, an hour at
most.  Then take a break, stretch, walk around, maybe exercise.

At the end of each day, write a list of things to do the next day.

Taking notes organizes your thoughts.  Allow yourself to take notes in any and
of the ways that you want.  Use paper and pencil, pen, paint, watercolor, or
crayon.  Take notes, rewrite them, throw them away.  Use blackboards,
whiteboards, whatever is available to see your thoughts and play with them.

One way to take notes digitally is with Markdown.  Markdown allows formatting
like links, headers, bold and italic text, horizontal rules, tables, and so on.
It's a lot easier to type than HTML.

I like to take notes in Markdown, keep them on GitHub, and link to more
information, mostly on Wikipedia and YouTube.

There is one gotcha to taking notes in Markdown.  If you have a link that has
special characters in it, you need to replace those special characters with
the appropriate URL encodings.  I most often encounter this with Wikipedia
links that contain parentheses.  The URL encoding for an opening paren is %28,
and for a closing paren is %29.  So "https://example.com/Contrived_(example)"
becomes "https://example.com/Contrived_%28example%29".
