# Productivity Notes

You're most effective in certain mental states and at certain times of day.
Avoid distractions during those times.

Set small, achievable, short term goals.  As in minutes.  Iterate rapidly.
Formalize your process (write it down, critique it, edit it, refine it).
Eliminate friction in your feedback loops.

You can only concentrate for so long before you become tired, and your body
needs exercise.  Have work sessions no more than 45 minutes ideally, an hour at
most.  Then take a break, stretch, walk around, maybe exercise.

At the end of each day, write a list of things to do the next day.

## Take Notes
Taking notes organizes your thoughts.  Allow yourself to take notes in any and
all of the ways that you want.  Use paper and pencil, pen, paint, watercolor,
or crayon.  Take notes, rewrite them, throw them away.  Use blackboards,
whiteboards, whatever is available to see your thoughts and play with them.

### Daily Goals
Each day, I like to write a brief list of goals.  No more than 6.  I prefer pen
and paper for this.  Drawing a line through a completed item, and balling up the
completed list are cathartic.  I also like to start with one completed item, to
trick myself into action.

### Intermediate Notes
For what I call intermediate notes (not for short term use, or long term
storage, but in between), I use whatever is most convenient.  For paper notes,
I like to to use a concise shorthand, like "flow" notes from debate.  If I'm
taking notes digitally, I use Markdown, but I save links and complex formatting
for later addition, so I'm mainly taking notes in plain text.

### Long-Term
For long-term storage, I prefer to take notes digitally and store them online
so I can easily access them.  There are several ways to do this.

### Markdown
One way to take notes digitally is with
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).  Markdown allows
formatting like links, headers, bold and italic text, horizontal rules, tables,
and so on.  It's a lot easier to type than
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Markup).  I like to take notes in
Markdown, keep them on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and link to more
information, mostly on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

#### URL Encoding
There is one gotcha to taking notes in Markdown.  If you have a link that has
special characters in it, you need to replace those special characters with
the appropriate [URL
encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).  I most often
encounter this with Wikipedia links that contain parentheses.  The URL encoding
for an opening paren is %28, and for a closing paren is %29.  So
"https://example.com/Contrived_(example)" becomes
"https://example.com/Contrived_%28example%29".

#### Link Fragments
Markdown files on GitHub are rendered as HTML.  You can link to headers within
the page with a hash symbol, followed by the header text in lowercase, with
special characters removed and spaces turned into hyphens.  So a link fragment
to a the line "# Table of Contents" is "#table-of-contents".

## List Tasks
For anything beyond the simplest of projects, it's useful to write down the
tasks you need to do.  One option is to use checklists, but those can be hard
to share with others and often don't provide enough detail or flexibility.

### Project Management
Project management tools, like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or
[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), allow you to document and
share tasks with a team.

## Communication
Email is universal and asynchronous, which means you have control over distractions.
Reply promptly and briefly.  "I got your email, thanks."  This encourages rapidly
iterating through feedback loops, which makes people more likely to contact you.
Build trust by following up without being asked.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is great for real-time communication, and for
sharing knowledge with your team.  Video conferencing is also helpful, to avoid
miscommunication and include remote workers.  I like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
for video chat, and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) for audio & text chat.
